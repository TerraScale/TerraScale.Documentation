## Verify Your Email

### POST /auth/verify-email

Verifies the user's email with a code sent to their inbox.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "pendingAuthenticationToken": "pat_abc123...",
  "code": "123456"
}
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `pendingAuthenticationToken` | string | Yes | Token from signup or login response |
| `code` | string | Yes | 6-digit verification code from email |

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGci...",
  "refreshToken": "rt_abc123...",
  "expiresIn": 3600,
  "userId": "usr_abc123",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "avatarUrl": null,
  "personalOrgId": "org_abc123",
  "permissions": ["database:read", "database:write"],

}
```

## Resend Verification Email

If you didn't receive the code or it expired, you can request a new one.

### POST /auth/resend-verification

Resends the verification email if the code expired or was not received.

**Request:**
```json
{
  "pendingAuthenticationToken": "pat_abc123..."
}
```

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Verification email sent"
}
```

:::note
Verification codes expire after 10 minutes. Request a new code if yours has expired.

## Troubleshooting

### Code Not Received

1. Check your spam/junk folder
2. Verify you entered the correct email during signup
3. Wait a few minutes - email delivery can be delayed
4. Use the resend verification endpoint to get a new code

### Code Expired

Verification codes are valid for 10 minutes. If expired:
1. Use the resend verification endpoint
2. Check your email for the new code
3. Enter the new code within 10 minutes

### Invalid Code

If you receive an "invalid code" error:
1. Ensure you're entering the most recent code
2. Check that you're using the correct `pendingAuthenticationToken`
3. Request a new code if needed

## C# SDK Example

```csharp
// After signup, verify the email
var verifyResult = await client.Auth.VerifyEmailAsync(new VerifyEmailRequest(
    PendingAuthenticationToken: pendingToken,
    Code: "123456"
));

if (verifyResult.IsSuccess)
{
    // Set the access token for future requests
    client.SetAccessToken(verifyResult.Value.AccessToken);
    Console.WriteLine($"Welcome, {verifyResult.Value.Name}!");
}

// If code expired, resend it
var resendResult = await client.Auth.ResendVerificationAsync(
    new ResendVerificationRequest(PendingAuthenticationToken: pendingToken)
);

if (resendResult.IsSuccess)
{
    Console.WriteLine("New verification code sent!");
}
```
