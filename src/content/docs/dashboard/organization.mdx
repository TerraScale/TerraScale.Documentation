## Best Practices

### Role Assignment

| Scenario | Recommended Role |
|----------|------------------|
| Co-founder/Partner | Owner (one) or Admin |
| Engineering team lead | Admin |
| Developer | Member |
| QA/Testing | Member or Read-only |
| External contractor | Member with time limit |
| Auditor | Read-only |

### Security Recommendations

1. **Limit Owners**: Have only one Owner per organization
2. **Use Admins sparingly**: Only trusted team leads
3. **Default to Member**: Most developers only need Member access
4. **Audit regularly**: Review member list quarterly
5. **Remove promptly**: Remove access when team members leave

### Onboarding Checklist

When inviting a new team member:

- [ ] Determine appropriate role
- [ ] Send invitation
- [ ] Share relevant documentation
- [ ] Verify they've accepted
- [ ] Help them generate their first API key
