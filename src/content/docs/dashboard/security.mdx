## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a verification code in addition to your password.

### Why Enable 2FA?

- Protects against password theft
- Prevents unauthorized access even if credentials leak
- Required for some compliance standards
- Best practice for production accounts

---

## Adding 2FA Methods

### Authenticator App (Recommended)

Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator, Authy, or 1Password:

1. Navigate to **Settings > Security**
2. Click **"Add Method"**
3. Select **"Authenticator App"**

#### Step 2: Scan QR Code

1. Open your authenticator app
2. Tap the "+" or "Add" button
3. Scan the QR code displayed
4. The app will show a 6-digit code

#### Step 3: Verify

1. Enter the 6-digit code from your app
2. Click **"Verify"**
3. Your authenticator is now active

**Supported Apps:**
- Google Authenticator

### Email Verification

Receive verification codes via email:

#### Step 1: Start Setup

1. Navigate to **Settings > Security**

## Managing 2FA Methods

### Viewing Enrolled Methods

The Security page shows all your 2FA methods:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Method** | Type (Authenticator or Email) |
| **Name** | Identifier (e.g., app name) |
| **Added** | Date enrolled |
| **Last Used** | Most recent verification |

### Removing a Method

To remove a 2FA method:

1. Find the method in the list
2. Click the **menu icon** (three dots)
3. Select **"Remove"**
4. Confirm with your password
5. Enter a verification code from another method (if you have multiple)

**Warning**: If you remove your only 2FA method, your account will no longer have two-factor protection.

### Adding Backup Methods

We recommend having multiple 2FA methods:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Primary: Authenticator" icon="approve-check">
    Fast and works offline. Use as your primary method.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backup: Email" icon="email">
    Works if you lose your phone. Add as a backup.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Logging In with 2FA

When 2FA is enabled, login requires two steps:

### Step 1: Enter Credentials

    1. Open your authenticator app
    2. Find your TerraScale entry
    3. Enter the current 6-digit code

  <TabItem label="Email">
    1. Click **"Send Code"** on the verification screen
    2. Check your email for the code
