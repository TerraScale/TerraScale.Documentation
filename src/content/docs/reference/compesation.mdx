We want to be extremely fair to you and also remain profitable, so we will not do the same as other
subscription based services that if you do not use your month's features and limits you will loose it.

### What will we do differently?
When you have some unused limits when we enter a new month we will roll over the previous month usage limit to the
next one.
#### Example:
- Example 1:
We are on January and you have a Pro plan, you just use 1 million operations but you still have 9 million that you did not use
we will add this extra 9 million to February as an extra usage so you will have 10 + 9, you will first use the original
February 10 million operations when you go over that amount you will use the extra 9 million, if you do not use the full
9 million extra operations that rolled over from January you will loose it.
As you used all your February limit March you will have only 10 million.

- Example 2:
We are on January you have a Pro plan you just used half(5 million operations) this 5 million will roll over to February
you will have a total of 10+5=15 million operations.
In February you just used 2 million operations, it will have a remaining of 8 million, in March you will have a total of
18 million operations to use.

### Over usage
We will allow you to over use the database and will never hard block any requests, we will warn you
that you are using more than you plan allows and if it passes more than 20% in a single month we will charge
for the excess, if it is less than 20% we will be a bro and just let you get away with it.

But if we feel that you are pushing it to the limits just to abuse this system we will warn and ask you to upgrade
politely and you will have plenty of time to upgrade or use your database less.

#### Example:

You are on Hobby plan you have 1 million operations if you over use less about 100 thousand we will not charge you
and we will not limit you, you will just get an warning e-mail.
But if you pass the 20% limit in a single month we will be forced to issue a separate charge to your credit card,
of course you can turn this feature off and we will simply block future requests if you prefer.
