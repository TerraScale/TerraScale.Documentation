# CosmosDB
Cosmos has pretty much all the features and it has more features than TerraScale, and is the closest comparison that 
we can make.

Pros:
- Stability
- Backed by Microsoft
- Reliable
- Has a lot of features
- SDK
- Azure

Cons:
- Price
- SDK 
- Azure

### Why is Azure both in Pros and Cons?
Well if you already use Azure it is quite easy to create a CosmosDB and get using and you will have unified charge.
But if you do not Azure account nor Azure experience it can be quite hard to find you way around.

# DynamoDB
Dynamo is a great product and it was one of the inspirations that made me create TerraScale.

Pros:
- Stability
- Backed by Amazon
- Reliable
- Has a lot of features
- SDK
- AWS

Cons:
- Price
- SDK 
- AWS

### Why is AWS both in Pros and Cons?
Well if you already use Azure it is quite easy to create a CosmosDB and get using and you will have unified charge.
But if you do not Azure account nor Azure experience it can be quite hard to find you way around.

# MongoDB
MongoDB is really hard to self host and have replica sets and the replica sets as far as i know

# Turso
At the beginning Turso was the closest thing similar to TerraScale and it was great to use and it would sync your data
between multiple regions and locally if you wanted.
But unfortunately they changed quite a bit, they reworked a lot of how it worked to be a local database first and 
Turso's server being a sync node instead of being a database node.

At TerraScale we believe that it is just easier and better to have your data in multiple locations and then you 
can just use the data there instead of downloading the whole database locally everytime in a stateless environment.
