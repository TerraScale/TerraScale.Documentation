# Migrations

Short explication we will not have a SQL like migration system or maybe we will not have it all.

# How to handle migration?

We can add a feature that you can write a javascript script that has some conditions and create the new fields or delete
old fields

Or the recommended way is when you access the data that has an old schema/structure you update it and save it.

# Why?

We think that writing migration using code is better than having something like EntityFramework that "magically" creeates
migration script for you that can fail and you have to battle with it to make it work or the common case of deleting
the migration history table and running everything again.
