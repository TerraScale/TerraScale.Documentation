# Why all regions have the same price as the others even though some are more expansive than others?
Well we tried to simplify the pricing plans and make your life easier to calculate how much you are going to
use and be easier to predict.

What we do is we calculate the median of all the regions prices so the cheaper regions compesates for the higher regions
we expected our users to use at average of 6 regions so this can work long term if it does not we can create a pricing per
region if needed before we have our stable release.


# Why do we use airport letter codes?
Well Linode and Fly.io uses airport codes and we thought that it worked great for them
and airport codes works(kinda works but works) and it is already an global standard
