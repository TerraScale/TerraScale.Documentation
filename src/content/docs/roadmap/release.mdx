# Planned features

- Auto index
We want to create an auto index algorithm so for example you have query X that is executed at least 100 times per day we
can create a groupped index of all the properties that you are using on that query to make future queries faster

- Auto caching
We want to agressively cache all queries that we can and automatically invalidate them as well
