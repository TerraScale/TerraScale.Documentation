Beta is going to be our next version and we do not have a release date

# Planned features

- Auto index
We want to create an auto index algorithm so for example you have query X that is executed at least 100 times per day we
can create a groupped index of all the properties that you are using on that query to make future queries faster

- Auto caching
We want to agressively cache all queries that we can and automatically invalidate them as well

#### Replication

#### Storage limitation
On alpha we plan to limit to 100gb on beta we want to raise this limit to 500gb

#### Caching
We want to add manual memory caching feature to our database so you can cache queries and invalidate them,
you are the one that controls it and we are going to use a LRU (Least recently used) system so let's say you have
1gb ram of cache allowence in your plan, you do not have to delete the queries manually as soon as you use more than 1gb ram
we are going to delete that oldest cached query to store the new query.
