description: Why TerraScale is not open source
---

We do not plan to open source some of TerraScale projects at this time.
While we appreciate the open source community and its contributions, we do not have the bandwidth to manage an open source project effectively at this moment.

But some projects are open source:
- [TerraScale Dashboard](https://github.com/TerraScale/TerraScale.Dashboard)
- [TerraScale Documentation](https://github.com/TerraScale/TerraScale.Documentation)

This does not mean we will never open source TerraScale, but for now, we are focusing on building a robust and reliable product.
